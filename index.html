                    <h3>Hotspring resorts</h3>
                    <p>Relaxing in hot springs is a real Taiwanese favorite. Mostly it's done in pools where you usually have three or four different water temperature pools. There are also natural hot springs which can be found in the mountains and near
                        the sea on the east coast. Next to the bigger hot springs, there are hot spring hotels. Where you can rent a room and spring water is pumped into a tub in your room or on the balcony.</p>
