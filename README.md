## UX

### Users

Users of the website are travel enthusiasts like myself. The kind of travelers that like to discover special places and 
hidden gems, instead of going with the masses. They visit the website to get introduced to a little known city which has a lot
to offer.

#### User stories

I started by creating [user stories]() to help determine what features to add to the website.

### design

In terms of design, I got inspiration from several (tourist)websites that I visited. I created a single page website because this 
makes it convenient for the visitor, to have all information together on one page. I used two text and background color combinations, white(#FFFFFF)
text on a blue/gray(#7a93b2) background, and dark gray(#343a40) text on a white background. The section alternate between the two combinations. The 
navbar and footer have light gray (#A0A0A0) text on a dark gray background. The font Helvetica has been used throughout the website. 

### Mockup

I created a mockup using [WIX](https://ivarsaris.wixsite.com/kaohsiung) 

## Features

Features implemented, and left to be implemented later. 

### Features implemented

### Features left to implement

* recommendations on what to do.
* *Slideshow* - The background image of the welcome text becomes a slideshow.
* *Poll* - Adding a poll to the foods to eat section. Where visitors can answer which foods they would like to try. The poll
