## UX

### Users

Users of the website are travel enthusiasts like myself. The kind of travelers that like to discover special places and 
hidden gems, instead of going with the masses. They visit the website to get introduced to a little known city which has a lot
to offer.

#### User stories

I started by creating [user stories](https://github.com/ivarsaris/Kaohsiung-tourist-website/blob/master/userstories) to help determine what features to add to the website.

### Design

In terms of design, I got inspiration from several (tourist)websites that I visited. I created a single page website because this 
makes it convenient for the visitor, to have all information together on one page. I used two text and background color combinations, white(#FFFFFF)
text on a blue/gray(#7a93b2) background, and dark gray(#343a40) text on a white background. The section alternate between the two combinations. The 
navbar and footer have light gray (#A0A0A0) text on a dark gray background. The font Helvetica has been used throughout the website. 

### Mockup

I created a mockup using [WIX](https://ivarsaris.wixsite.com/kaohsiung) 

## Features

Features implemented, and left to implement later. 

### Features implemented

* **Scroling navigation -** The visitor can navigate through the page with the navbar at the top. When clicking on the section, the page smooth scrolls to this section. It was choosen to not display the navbar on smaller screens because it takes up too much screen real estate.
* **Google maps API with markers -** Visitors can find a map with recommended activities.
* **Filter function -** Visitors can filter these activities and return all cultural or nature activities on the map.
* **Information dropdown and marker activation -** When clicking on an activity, an information section drops down. Also the marker on the map is activated so the visitor sees where the activity is located.
* **Form which sends e-mail -** The visitor can fill out and submit a form on the website. This will send an e-mail to the website creator. The content of the e-mail is a template completed with information from the answers on the form.

### Features left to implement

* **Second map for finding hotels -** Visitors can see a map with hotels in Kaohsiung.
* **Interactive personal advice -** Visitor can answer some questions on what kind of activities they like, and they get recommendations on what to do.
* **Slideshow -** The background image of the welcome text becomes a slideshow.
* **Poll -** Adding a poll to the foods to eat section. Where visitors can answer which foods they would like to try. The poll keeps track of the answers.

## Testing 

The website achieved the goal set out. Visitors get introduced to the city of Kaohsiung. They can find activities to do, foods to eat and where, information on accommodation types, and fill out a form to get a custom-tailored holiday send to them. For the visitor it‚Äôs easy to access any part of the webpage with the smooth scrolling navigation bar.  

### Responsiveness 

The website has been tested on several devices in order to see if it‚Äôs responsive to any screen size. The website was tested on a dell laptop, a microsoft laptop, a MacBook, an iPad, an iPhone 7 and an Honor 10. On all devices the layout worked well. There was one bug on a mobile device. The dropdown navbar wasn‚Äôt convenient to use. Since the website is not very long, it was easier to scroll to the section. For this reason, I set the navbar on display: none on a small screen. This way the navbar doesn‚Äôt take up any screen space on a mobile.  

### Browser compatibility 

The website has been run in several browsers to make sure it‚Äôs compatible with the most common ones. The website runs well in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.
